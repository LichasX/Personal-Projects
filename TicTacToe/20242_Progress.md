WIP
80% completed. 

Things to do:
1. fix function win_check(), game is unable to detect any matches or end via draw if round num = num of board spaces
    - maybe try checking board individually to see if any are unfilled to fulfill draw criteria
2. Main issues are line 29 to 57 (which is win_check()), possibly line 61 (unable to end by draw) 


TLDR of done:
1. printing of board/formatting
2. receving player input and correctly adding input to the board
3. round of game is kept track and allows players to take alternate turns
